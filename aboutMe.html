            <p>
              I've always had a creative mindset and a strong interest in
              technology. Learning how different tools and programs work has
              always come naturally to me, which sparked my desire to build a
              career in the digital world. <br />

              During high school (HTX), I was introduced to programming with
              Python and C++, as well as web design using HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. I quickly fell in love with frontend development,
              especially the visual and interactive aspects of creating
              websites. <br />

              After graduating, I began studying Game Development and Learning
              Technology at SDU. Here, I worked with C# in Unity, Java, MongoDB,
              and R, and I gained a solid understanding of design theory,
              particularly in the context of game development. While it was a
              valuable experience, I realized that my true passion lies in web
              design, so I chose to change direction. <br />

              I'm now studying Multimedia Design at UCL, where I can focus more
              deeply on what I enjoy most: designing and building websites. I
              love working with frontend code to bring hi-fi prototypes and
              mockups to life, whether it's through experimenting with color
              schemes, implementing responsive designs, or solving design
              problems with creative code solutions.
